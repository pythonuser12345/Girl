# Girl
A girl with long black hair, brown eyes, and a blue shirt. This is a girl and is was created as a drawing on Visual Studio Code. I used many different drawing functions to make this drawing. I used circles, polygons, rectangles, and ellipses. What inspired me to make this was watching cartoons with similar looking chartacters.
